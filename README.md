# printf

## TODO

For character specifier

**%c** => handle char type
**%d** or **%i** => handle print for values greater than 9
**%s** => handle character string extraction from *va_arg*
and assign it to as varaible which has been commented out in the printf.c code

Split the printf code in separate fucntion so that a the 
betty checker doesn't freak out when function exceeds 40
lines

the man page also needs work
